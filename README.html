</code></pre>

<h2 id="notesonfunctionality:">Notes on functionality:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drive the creation of your app using tests - either cucumber or rspec as you prefer</li>
<li>Use data mapper and postgres to save the data.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to be logged in to see the peeps.</li>
<li>Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a user name (e.g. sam@makersacademy.com, s3cr3t, Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph, tansaku).</li>
<li>The username and email are unique.</li>
<li>Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.</li>
<li>Use bcrypt to secure the passwords.</li>
<li>You only can peep if you are logged in.</li>
<li>Please ensure that you update your README to indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests</li>
<li>Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution. However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bonus:">Bonus:</h2>

<p>If you have time you can implement the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.</li>
</ul>

<p>And/Or:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work on the css to make it look good (we all like beautiful things).</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck and let the chitter begin!</p>

<h2 id="codereview">Code Review</h2>

<p>In code review we&#8217;ll be hoping to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>All tests passing</li>
<li>High <a href="https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md">Test coverage</a> (&gt;95% is good)</li>
<li>The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reviewers will potentially be using this <a href="docs/review.md">code review rubric</a>. Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier. You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.</p>

<h2 id="notesontestcoverage">Notes on test coverage</h2>

<p>Please ensure you have the following <strong>AT THE TOP</strong> of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
</code></pre>

<p>You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the <code>HTMLFormatter</code> line and see what happens!</p>
